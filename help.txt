How To play Hi-Lo V2.0

This game is very simple to play.
All you have to do is guess if the face down
card on the right will be higher or lower than
the card shown on the left.

If you have earned at least 1pt the "CHANGE"
button Will become available.

Click the change button if you want
to change a bad card, this will cost you 1pt,
off of your score with no guarantee of
getting a better card.

A Joker is wild, i.e. counted as anything.

If you have 3pts or more the "JOKER" button will
become available to you at a cost of 3pts per use.
This will deal you a guaranteed joker on card two,
ensuring a win to the next round.

Aces are counted as the highest card.

Your high score will be saved to disc and reloaded
the next time you play.

Music and sound effects can be switched on and off
from the Music menu as per your desire.


Enjoy.)
