How To play Hi-Lo V1.73.

This game is very simple to play.
All you have to do is guess if the face down
card on the right will be higher or lower than
the card shown on the left.

If you have at least 1pt the "CHANGE CARD"
button Will become available.

Click the change card button if you want
to change a bad card, this will cost you 1pt,
with no guarantee of getting a better card.

A Joker is wild, i.e. counted as anything.
If you turn over two jokers together you will
be awarded a bonus of 3pts.

If you have 4pts or more the "JOKER" button will
become available to you at a cost of 4pts per use.
This will deal you a guaranteed joker on card two,
ensuring a win to the next round.

Any pair also gives you a win to the next round.

Aces are counted as the highest card.

Your high score will be saved to disc and reloaded
the next time you play.

Enjoy.)
